<p>
When I grab that brush  <br>
I lose control of the world around me; <br>
with a clear uninterrupted mind
I go on a spiritual journey. <br>
</P>

<p>
I merge into the subconscious  <br>
In pursuit of self realisation <br>
I reach the vanguard of that divine orgasm that triggers my creative hormones. <br>
</p>
<p>
Through the priceless bristles of sable <br>
pour pure hues of paint <br>
Onto an innocent virgin white canvas. <br>
</p>

<p>
Creating a whole new spectrum <br>
A new disciple of colours <br>
that smell like the sweet fragrance of a jack fruit <br>
and shout out aloud. <br>
</p>
<p>
Like the buzzing of warriors <br>
washing from the successful encounter that profound ego to create <br>
Emanating from the very essence of my existence reincarnates another hidden soul <br>
through that brush! <br>
</p>

- Samson Ssenkaaba(Uganda)
